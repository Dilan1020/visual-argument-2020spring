# Dilan's Visual Argument

### For my visual argument, I will attempt to create an graphic that comments on the social media use and addiction that influences almost all young people in America today. The goal of my image will be 'look up', an argument for focusing more on in-person interactions and conversations rather than the screen in our pockets.

### My preview will simply show some cut outs in the bottom of the image. These assets may not end up in those positions. I wanted something that I could work with as I continue to make progess on my visual argument. I have put a blue gradient in the background, this may also change as the project grows. An idea that was brought to me was to take the brain cut-out and perhaps put in onto an clip-art person looking at their phone. I will explore this idea.

### Lastly, I plan on adding the words "LOOK UP" in the top of the image as the most eye-grabbing aspect of the design. This is important because "LOOK UP" can be though of as the argument of the peice, that social media and cell phone use is taking a toll on personal relationships and society as a whole.
